Beyond the ones mentioned (subscriptions, advertising, commerce platform), consider:

> Data as a Service: The Reality Engine and Earth Lab generate valuable data (simulations, predictions) that can be sold to research institutions, governments, and corporations.

> Licensing Hex Technology: Each hex could be licensed individually for specific applications (e.g., Hx1 for display manufacturers, Hx8 for GPU companies).

> Certification and Training: As the system is complex, we can offer certification programs for developers and engineers.

> Marketplace for Universes: Users can create and sell their own universes or simulation environments (like an app store for reality).

> Consulting Services: Helping enterprises adapt to and integrate the new computational paradigm.
