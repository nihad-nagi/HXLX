6. MACRO - V1: Business Model & Economic Architecture

DOCUMENT STATUS: This MACRO section provides complete business model and economic architecture for the MINI LX ecosystem. The model demonstrates unprecedented unit economics, defensible moats, and civilization-scale economic impact potential.

6.1 The Economic Inversion
We don't sell software—we enable value creation. We don't capture markets—we create new economic layers. Our approach transforms traditional business models by:

Value Creation Over Extraction: Building ecosystems where all participants benefit

Time Monetization: Converting wasted time (boot cycles) into economic value

Attention Democratization: Making attention a transparent, tradable asset

Creativity Amplification: Turning human potential into measurable economic output
