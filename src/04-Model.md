# 4. Model


Our business model is multi-layered:

  > Layer 1: Zero Boot: Freemium model (ad-supported free tier and subscription for power users). This is the entry point for user acquisition.

  > Layer 2: Reality Engine: Licensing to researchers, enterprises, and governments for truth discovery and simulation.

  > Layer 3: HiveOS and HoT: Ecosystem fees for device manufacturers and developers (like Android but for the hive).

  > Layer 4: COSMOS: Transaction fees on the creativity economy (carat development and value exchange).

  > Layer 5: Earth Exchange of Ether: A marketplace for attention and creativity tokens, taking a small percentage on transactions.

  > We aim to create a win-win-win: users get free or cheap services, advertisers get targeted attention, and we take a small cut of the value created.
