THE EM SPECTRUM CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

The Global Classifier for All Paradigm Elements

The electromagnetic spectrum provides the universal stratification framework for the entire system. Each quadrant corresponds to a fundamental computational domain:
EM Quadrant	Wavelength Range	Computational Domain	Physical Manifestation
RED	620-750 nm	Infrastructure / Physical	Hardware, photons as particles, deterministic state
GREEN	495-570 nm	Subsurface / Systems	Protocols, orchestration, distributed coordination
BLUE	450-495 nm	Ionosphere / Virtual	Abstraction, simulation, predictive intelligence
VIOLET	380-450 nm	Frontier / Ultra	Speculative, emergent, consciousness-adjacent phenomena

BASIC: Everything in this system is color-coded by what it does, following how light naturally works in reality.

NORMAL: The EM spectrum provides the canonical classification system. Each color band corresponds to a specific computational domain, from physical infrastructure (RED) to frontier consciousness research (VIOLET).

TECHNICAL: Photon wavelength provides inherent semantic classification. The framework maps computational constructs onto EM quadrants: RED (λ=620-750nm) for physical/infra states, GREEN (λ=495-570nm) for systems orchestration, BLUE (λ=450-495nm) for virtual abstractions, VIOLET (λ=380-450nm) for frontier/speculative research. This creates wavelength-based semantic addressing across all computational layers.
