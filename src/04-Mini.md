## LX0: Zero Boot
Freemium model (ad-supported free tier and subscription for power users). This is the entry point for user acquisition.

Technical Execution:
```yaml
  7-State Consciousness Calibration:

    AWAKENING - State injection

    CALIBRATING - Reality testing

    SENSING - Perceptual activation

    UNDERSTANDING - Context loading

    READY - Operational preparedness

    CREATING - Purpose fulfillment
```
    Frame-Based Booting: Compressed memory states as boot "frames"
