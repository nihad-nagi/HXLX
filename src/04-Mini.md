### BASIC
This is our development timeline. Each branch is a product being built from the foundational discoveries. The main line (PIPE) is where stable releases merge.

### NORMAL
The pipeline map shows the evolutionary development of products from foundational Hexes. Each branch represents a product line, with commits marking the integration of specific Hexes (REVERSE) and product releases (HIGHLIGHT).

### TECHNICAL
Version-controlled product genesis pipeline using Git semantics. Branches represent product lines, REVERSE commits represent Hex primitive integration, HIGHLIGHT commits represent product releases. The graph shows dependency relationships and parallel development streams.

#### Architecture:
    
    PIPE Branch: Main release pipeline - all product lines eventually merge here

    REVERSE Commits: Hex primitive integrations (Hx00, Hx01, etc.)

    HIGHLIGHT Commits: Product releases (B00T, ZB00Tv1, etc.)

    Branch Strategy: Each product line evolves independently before integration

### Assembly Principle
Products are built by combining Hex primitives in specific configurations. Each product represents a practical instantiation of experimented primitives.
